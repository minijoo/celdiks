Things the 2020 Celtics need more of..

 - **Attitude**: Marcus Smart notwithstanding, they don't have the guy who will take a couple in the chin for the good of the team. Who is backing up Marcus Smart when he gets into it with Simmons and Embiid? Who's going to give Giannis a cautionary shove when he's having his way in the paint? 
 - **Ball handlers**: The "point" position this year is being done by committee. Any one of these players can be bringing the ball up at any given point: Hayward, Kemba, Smart, Wanamaker, and dare I say Tatum. This just seems like a way to not put the pressure on one person who also probably couldn't handle it. They need to get one or get rid of the committee.
 - **Unpredictability/Freedom**: While they may have the most talented team on paper, they have to be one of the easiest team put a gameplan around and have it actually work. You can see nearly every play happen before it plays out (this may explain the lack of memorable moments). If you have a really good gameplan and stick to it, this team is really easy to beat. Personally, I would have the other team try to hang around for 40 minutes, and crank up everything in crunch time forcing the ball to the perimiters to the guys with quick triggers (basically all of them). 

The thing about Kyrie is that he gave us so many ooohs and aaahs in return for violating our innocence.
