<p>Hello. We are officially in the heart of the Information Age, the age where there is a surplus of information that may be easily accessible, but on the other that bombards you every single day. So much of the information is nugget-sized, unorganized and nonuniform that you are left in an information coma when you come out the other end. What I want to do with this blog is serve a practical purpose of orchestrating and distilling the content out there that at this point I am capable of rummaging through efficiently and present it here. The information group that lacks this the most is that of Celtics basketball which is what I will focus on primarily.</p>
<p>For this inaugural post, I will start with Evan Turner. With the covid pandemic still going on, there haven't really been much basketball news other than the flipflopping sentiments about the restart. What is for certain is that Evan Turner is baller. It has been ten years since he was drafted into the NBA and those two years he had with the Celtics was dope. People forget he was a near triple-double machine in Coach Stevens' system, handled the ball effortlessly, and torched Lebron at least once a game. With him handling the ball so much more, we got to see so many more moves, even some that we hadn't seen. His ways to create space were primarily:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Hesi into right-to-left cross (a la Iverson but starting from the right)</p></li>
<li><p>Hard two dribbles to the right into the paint then pull back abruptly throwing ball behind the back to the left with a left shoulder/arm counter-movement into the defender (usually done off of pick n roll drives where his defender doesn't switch and loses a half-step)</p></li>
<li><p>Left stiff-arm on elongated layup gathers (stiff-arm also used in the move #2 above)</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Not enough to be a full entry in the list but "taking Kirk Heinrich one-on-one every time down the floor" was notable.</p>
<p>And we can't forget the great passing that led to career high in assists one of those seasons. This is what makes him a baller. When you see a player consistently make reads that are not obvious to you, you know he's been balling basically all his life.</p>
<p>With that, please watch these incredibe highlights (shout out to the production team that made these!).</p>
